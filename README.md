# 📡 Wireless Dual-Servo Controller 📡

This is an embedded systems project built with two Arduino Nano boards, each based on the ATmega328P microcontroller, and nRF24L01+PA+LNA RF modules to wirelessly control two hobby servos using an analog joystick. All code is written in low-level C, without relying on any high-level abstraction libraries. 

Below is a summary of the skills I gained during the project:

- **Low-level C & register programming** on AVR  
- **SPI & ADC setup** for efficient data exchange and analog sampling  
- **Interrupt-driven data flow** to guarantee real-time responsiveness  
- **Timer-based PWM generation** at 50 Hz for accurate servo control  
- **RF link configuration** and power-up sequencing per nRF24L01 datasheet  
- **Datasheet interpretation**, extracting register settings and timing constraints

## 🚀 Workflow

**1. Read Joystick Inputs**
     The transmitter MCU samples the two analog axes of the joystick via its ADC and converts those readings into digital values.

**2. Send Data to RF Module**
     The MCU packages the joystick values into a data packet and transfers it over SPI to the nRF24L01+ configured as a transmitter.

**3. Transmit Over the Air**
     The nRF24L01+ radio module sends the packet wirelessly to the paired receiver module.

**4. Receive and Forward Data**
     The nRF24L01+ receiver module captures the incoming packet and relays it over SPI to the receiver MCU.

**5. Generate PWM for Servos**
     The receiver MCU reads the joystick values, maps them to appropriate register settings, and drives two PWM outputs—one for each servo motor—to control speed and direction.

## 📐 Hardware Design

The schematics and PCB were designed using the EasyEDA platform.
Some components included in the design, such as a Bluetooth module, are not yet implemented — they are reserved for future development. This project is intended to evolve into a full drone system, where many additional features will be integrated.

## 🎮 Controls

Assuming you hold the joystick with its pin header facing you, the **X-axis** is vertical and the **Y-axis** is horizontal. Moving the stick toward an extreme both changes direction and increases speed.

- **X-axis (vertical)**  
  - **Up** (X positive): Servo A rotates **clockwise**  
  - **Center** (X = 0): Servo A stops  
  - **Down** (X negative): Servo A rotates **counter-clockwise**  

- **Y-axis (horizontal)**  
  - **Right** (Y positive): Servo B rotates **clockwise**  
  - **Center** (Y = 0): Servo B stops  
  - **Left** (Y negative): Servo B rotates **counter-clockwise**  

- **Diagonal positions**  
  - **Up + Right** (X+, Y+): Both servos rotate **clockwise**  
  - **Up + Left**  (X+, Y–): Servo A clockwise, Servo B counter-clockwise  
  - **Down + Right** (X–, Y+): Servo A counter-clockwise, Servo B clockwise  
  - **Down + Left** (X–, Y–): Both servos rotate **counter-clockwise**  

> 👉 The closer the joystick is to an extreme, the faster that servo will spin in the chosen direction. Full deflection = maximum speed.
